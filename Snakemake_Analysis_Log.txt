## Start by downloading Snakemake using conda. Mamba has to be downloaded first for initiation - recommended to be installed in an environment called "base".

conda install -n base -c conda-forge mamba
conda activate base

## Snakemake is downloaded in an environment called snakemake.
mamba create -c conda-forge -c bioconda -n snakemake snakemake
conda deactivate

conda activate snakemake
touch Snakefile             # Creation of Snakefile
snakemake -n                # Dry run of Snakefile
conda deactivate

## Will have to activate the snakemake environment before running and testing the file.
